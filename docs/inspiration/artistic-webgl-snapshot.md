## üé® Aesthetic Vision

- **Fractal / Recursive Geometry**
  - Inspired by circle packing, Mandelbrot sets, and mathematical recursion.
  - Balanced complexity ‚Äî dense but meditative.

- **Escher / Hofstadter / GEB Influence**
  - Themes of self-reference, paradox, figure vs. ground.
  - Philosophical undercurrents in the visual language.

- **Organic & Natural Feel**
  - Soft motion, flowing transitions, non-mechanical rhythms.
  - A subtle color palette and lighting to evoke natural calm.

- **Subtle Interactivity**
  - Interactions that feel meaningful and integrated into the visual logic.
  - Scroll, mouse movement, or time-based progression.

## üß± Technical Stack (Recommended)

- `React` + `@react-three/fiber` ‚Äî Declarative 3D with familiar React patterns.
- `@react-three/drei` ‚Äî Helper components (cameras, lights, geometry).
- `GLSL shaders` ‚Äî For recursive visuals, generative textures, organic motion.
- `postprocessing` ‚Äî Bloom, vignette, subtle blur.
- `Leva` (optional) ‚Äî Live tweaking controls for visuals and animation params.

## üß† Next Steps (All of Interest)

1. **Starter Scene**: Recursive Circle Packing (like reference image).
2. **Shader-Based Scene**: Explore fractals or flow-based visuals.
3. **Design / Layout Exploration**: Transitions, structure, figure-ground tension.
