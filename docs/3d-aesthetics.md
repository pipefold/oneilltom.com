# Design, Layout & Aesthetics (3D Web Focus)

*   **Goal:** Create a visually engaging user interface that reflects capabilities in 3D web development.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Choice of 3D library (e.g., Three.js, React Three Fiber, Babylon.js).
    *   Integration of 3D elements into the Next.js/React structure.
    *   Performance optimization for 3D rendering in the browser.
    *   Balancing aesthetics with usability and accessibility.
    *   Responsive design for various screen sizes.
    *   Overall site layout and navigation incorporating 3D elements.
*   **Documents:**
    *   *(Links to specific documents like UI/UX Mockups, 3D Integration Plan, Performance Budget, etc. will go here)*

### Content Integration & Figure/Ground Exploration

A core challenge and opportunity is integrating the Markdown-based content (sourced from Nostr) with the 3D aesthetic. This goes beyond simply placing text over a background.

*   **Goal:** Explore visually compelling ways to present text content within or alongside the 3D environment, potentially drawing inspiration from the recursive figure/ground concepts in GEB.
*   **Potential Approaches:**
    *   **HTML Overlay:** Standard HTML/CSS rendering on top of the 3D canvas. Focus on how the background interacts visually (framing, competing elements).
    *   **HTML within 3D:** Using tools like React Three Fiber's `<Html>` component to position HTML content spatially within the 3D scene (e.g., on planes, surfaces). Allows for more dynamic camera interactions.
    *   **Environment Reactivity:** Having the 3D scene dynamically change (colors, shapes, animations) based on the content being viewed (e.g., Nostr tags, scroll position).
    *   **Recursive/Spatial Layout:** Designing the 3D environment and text layout such that the distinction between content container ("figure") and environment ("ground") becomes ambiguous or interchangeable through perspective, animation, or interaction.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   Performance implications of rendering HTML within WebGL.
    *   Maintaining text legibility and accessibility.
    *   Choosing the right R3F/Three.js techniques (e.g., `<Html>`, `CSS3DRenderer`).
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Prototype small visual experiments for different integration approaches.
    *   Develop specific visual concepts inspired by GEB's figure/ground examples.
