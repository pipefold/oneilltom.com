# Planning and Architecture

This directory contains documents related to the planning and architecture of the project: a personal website showcasing 3D web development skills and rendering long-form content sourced from Nostr relays.

## Key Areas

### 1. Content Management & Rendering (Nostr Integration)

*   **Goal:** Fetch and display long-form content (articles, blog posts) stored as Nostr events (e.g., kind 30023).
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Identifying relevant Nostr relays (public, personal, etc.).
    *   Querying relays using filters:
        *   `authors`: Your public key.
        *   `kinds`: Primarily long-form content (e.g., 30023).
        *   `#t` tags: To categorize content (e.g., 'blog', 'project-update', 'notes').
    *   Mapping specific Nostr queries (tags, kinds) to different sections/pages of the website.
    *   Parsing Nostr event content (likely Markdown within the `.content` field).
    *   Rendering Markdown to HTML effectively within the Next.js app (choosing a library like `react-markdown` or `marked`).
    *   Handling potential performance issues (relay latency, data volume).
    *   Caching strategies (client-side, server-side, ISR/SSR).

### 2. Design, Layout & Aesthetics (3D Web Focus)

*   **Goal:** Create a visually engaging user interface that reflects capabilities in 3D web development.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Choice of 3D library (e.g., Three.js, React Three Fiber, Babylon.js).
    *   Integration of 3D elements into the Next.js/React structure.
    *   Performance optimization for 3D rendering in the browser.
    *   Balancing aesthetics with usability and accessibility.
    *   Responsive design for various screen sizes.
    *   Overall site layout and navigation incorporating 3D elements.
