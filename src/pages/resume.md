## Work Experience

### Lead 3D Web Engineer

Open Systems Lab, Remote/UK
November 2021 – March 2025

- Led development of [BuildX](https://github.com/pipefold/buildx-app/blob/main/README.md) :github: prototype, a 3D web app for modular housing design (e.g., WikiHouse integration); implemented real-time parametric modeling, interactive 3D manipulations with oriented bounding box collision detection and constructive solid geometry operations (three-bvh-csg), geospatial site selection (Mapbox GL, Turf.js), analytics for embodied carbon and cost estimations, and build outputs including bill of materials, order lists, and CSV/3D exports.

<!-- - Engineered robust, scalable solutions using functional programming patterns (fp-ts for complex data transformations and error handling with TaskEither), reactive state management (Valtio), and type safety (TypeScript, Zod); optimized performance with Web Workers for heavy computations (e.g., model exports, PNG snapshots), local caching (Dexie for IndexedDB), Airtable API for build system data (including model URLs), and Speckle for 3D model parsing to ensure a performant UI. -->

- Directed frontend redevelopment of [Atlas of Ownership](https://atlasofownership.org) :globe_with_meridians: from a prior setup; built a Mapbox GL and Next.js platform for browsing/searching land ownership on a 3D globe; synchronized routing, SSR, navigation, and interactive visualizations for seamless UX.

### Co-Founder & Lead Developer

Bearjam (defunct), Remote
January 2020 – November 2021

- Developed Dream Builder, a 2D digital vision boarding app in 3D space using React Three Fiber (Three.js); documented architecture and implementation in a blog post series.
- Built Bear Bookshop, an e-commerce site for a local bookstore with Stripe and iZettle integrations for payments and point-of-sale functionality.

### Prospective Founder

Free the Data via Social Digital Innovation, Berlin, Germany
June 2017 – December 2017

- Developed business plan and open-source software concept for user-managed, distributed data stores enabling cross-channel data control.
- Prototyped a React Native mobile app for location tracking; gained foundational skills in entrepreneurship and decentralized systems.

### Systems Engineer & Developer

Claranet, London, UK
November 2015 – April 2017

- Automated network and server configurations using open-source DevOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible); programmed in Python, Golang, and shell scripting.
