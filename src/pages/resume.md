## Work Experience

### Lead 3D Web Engineer

Open Systems Lab, Remote/UK  
November 2021 – March 2025

- Led development of BuildX prototype, a 3D web app for DfMA housing design (e.g., WikiHouse integration); implemented real-time parametric modeling, interactive 3D manipulations with OBB collision detection and CSG operations (three-bvh-csg), geospatial site selection (Mapbox GL, Turf.js), and analytics for embodied carbon, cost estimations, bill of materials, and order lists with CSV/3D exports (GLTF/OBJ).
- Engineered robust, scalable solutions using functional programming patterns (fp-ts for complex data transformations and error handling with TaskEither), reactive state management (Valtio), and type safety (TypeScript, Zod); optimized performance with Web Workers for heavy computations (e.g., model exports, PNG snapshots), local caching (Dexie for IndexedDB), Airtable API for build system data (including model URLs), and Speckle for BIM/IFC parsing to ensure responsive UI.
- Led frontend redevelopment of Atlas of Ownership (atlasofownership.org) from a prior setup, building a Mapbox GL and Next.js platform for browsing/searching land ownership on a 3D globe; synchronized routing, SSR, navigation, and interactive visualizations for seamless UX.
- Collaborated with CEO and architects to integrate sustainability metrics (e.g., net carbon impact calculations) and manufacturing outputs, enhancing WikiHouse tools for real-world DfMA applications.

### Freelance Web Developer & Entrepreneur

Various (Self-Employed / Pipe Fold Ltd), UK & Berlin

- Co-founded a web development partnership (2020–2021), delivering a full eCommerce and Point-of-Sale solution for Bear Bookshop using Shopify, Next.js, and iZettle integration; handled backend setup and frontend design for a local Birmingham bookstore.
- Participated in Social Digital Innovation incubator in Berlin (June–December 2017) to conceptualize "Free the Data," a social impact startup bridging proprietary platform data (e.g., Spotify, Google) into p2p systems for user analytics and algorithmic matching.
- Managed freelance projects under Pipe Fold Ltd, applying web and systems expertise to experimental tech ventures.

### Automation Developer

Claranet, UK  
November 2015 – April 2017

- Programmed in Python, Golang, and shell scripting; contributed to proof-of-concept deployment of OpenStack.
- Submitted contributions to OpenStack Kolla project (e.g., Neutron BGP Dynamic Routing Agent blueprint).
- Built in-house configuration management tools, including UI and REST API in Java, and automation scripts in Perl.

### Service Desk Analyst

SCC, UK  
May 2014 – October 2015

- Provided 24/7 user-facing technical support in a NOC for SCC’s secure multi-tenant government cloud platform (Sentinel).
- Maintained NSV SC clearance; independently completed CCNA certification to enhance networking fundamentals (e.g., subnetting, IP configuration, DHCP protocols).
