# BuildX

A powerful build system for modern development workflows.

## Overview

BuildX is a modern build system designed to streamline development workflows. 
It provides fast, reliable builds with intelligent caching and parallel execution.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent dependency resolution** - Automatically detects and resolves dependencies
- **Parallel build execution** - Builds multiple targets simultaneously
- **Incremental compilation** - Only rebuilds what's changed
- **Plugin ecosystem** - Extensible architecture for custom build steps

## Technology Stack

Built with Rust for performance and reliability, featuring a clean CLI interface 
and comprehensive documentation.

## Code Example

```bash
# Install BuildX
cargo install buildx

# Build a project
buildx build --target release

# Run with watch mode
buildx watch --target dev
```

## Results

- 50% faster build times compared to traditional build systems
- Reduced memory usage through intelligent caching
- Seamless integration with existing CI/CD pipelines
